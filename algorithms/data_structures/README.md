# Data Structures

## Queues
- **FIFO** **F**irst **I**n **F**irst **O**ut - just like a queue in real life, the first person in line gets actioned first. The last person in the queue gets actioned last.
- Operations
    - `Enqueue` / `Push` - Add element to the rear
    - `Dequeue` - Remove and return the element at the front
    - `Peek` / `Front` - Look at the element at the front without removing it
    - `isEmpty` - Test if queue has no elements
    - `Size` - Returns the size of the queue

## Stacks
- **LIFO** **L**ast **I**n **F**irst **O**ut - just like a stack of papers on your desk, you add and remove from the top.
- Operations
    - `Push` - Add element to the top
    - `Pop` - Remove and return the top element
    - `Peek` / `Top` - Look at the top element without removing it
    - `isEmpty` - Test if stack has no elements
    - `Size` - Returns the size of the queue
