# 🧠 Software Development Handbook

## ✨ Foreword

Software development is part art form, part mathematics, part science — and part vibe.
This handbook is a curated collection of what I’m learning: design patterns, algorithms, data structures, and foundational concepts.
It’s part learning tool, part long-term reference.

It will grow as my knowledge and skills grow. I hope you find something useful in here, too — as I follow in the footsteps of giants and explore the endless world of code.

### Conceptual View Patterns &amp; Algorithms
* **Design Patterns** - A strategic and architectual level looking at how should I structure and shape this solution?
* **Algorithms** - A tactical and procedural level looking at how should I perform operations to efficiently solve this task.
